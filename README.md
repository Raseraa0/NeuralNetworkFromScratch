# 📌 Neural Network From Scratch

## 📝 Overview

This project, entirely done in `C++`, aims to reproduce a `neural network`. I am strongly inspired by the operation of `Keras` in Python, with a neural network to which you can add the layers you want.
This project aims to familiarize myself more with C++, and to help me understand in detail how neural networks work.
